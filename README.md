# GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy Correlations

### Project Overview
This project seeks to explore the relationship between the GDP per capita and life expectancy across various countries through data visualization. Additionally, it aims to analyze and interpret patterns to determine which continents exhibit higher or lower levels of GDP per capita and life expectancy.

### Data Sources
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tklimonova/gapminder-datacamp-2007

### Tools
- Python - date preprocessing and data visualization
- SQL - exploratory data analysis and data analysis

### Data Preprocessing
Integrating a column indicating continent-based colors into the dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The questions related to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) include:
1. Identifying the presence of continents.
2. Evaluating the average GDP per capita.
3. Assessing the average life expectancy.
4. Calculating the average population.

### Data Analysis
The SQL-based data analysis comprises the following tasks:
1. Arranging continents based on life expectancy.
2. Identifying continents with above-average GDP and life expectancy.
3. Retrieving countries sorted by population in descending order.

### Data Visualization

### Results
- In the realm of data visualization, there is a tendency for countries with high GDP to also exhibit high life expectancy, while conversely, no countries with low GDP display high life expectancy.
- Oceania takes the lead in both average GDP per capita and life expectancy, while Africa trails behind with the lowest rankings in these aspects.
- Asia, Europe, and Oceania emerge as continents with total GDP per capita and life expectancy above the average.
- China and India occupy the foremost positions for having the largest populations among all countries.

### Recommendations
- Target interventions to improve economic prosperity and life expectancy in countries with lower GDP.
- Learn from Oceania's success in achieving high GDP per capita and life expectancy, and explore similar strategies for other regions, especially Africa.
- Allocate resources strategically in Asia, Europe, and Oceania, given their above-average total GDP per capita and life expectancy.
- Develop tailored policies for the substantial populations in China and India to address specific challenges and opportunities.
